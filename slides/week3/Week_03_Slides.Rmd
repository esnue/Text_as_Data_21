# Goals for Today

## Goals

- Introduction to data transformation with dplyr
- Learn how to collect your own (text) data from the web


# Part I: Data transformation with dplyr


## Dataset for today

336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(flights[1:4, 1:6])
```

## `dplyr` core functions

- `filter()`: select rows by their values
- `arrange()`: order rows
- `select()`: select columns by their names
- `mutate()`: create new variables
- `summarize()`: collapse many values down to a single summary

- `group_by()`: operate on it group-by-group
- `rename()`: rename columns
- `distinct()`: find distinct rows

## `dplyr` command structure

- first argument is a data frame
- return value is a data frame
- nothing is modified in place

## `filter()`

`filter()` allows to subset observations based on their values. The function takes logical expressions and returns the rows for which all are `TRUE`. 

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/filter.png")
```  

## `filter()`

Let's select all flights on January 1st:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)[1:6, 1:6])
```

## `filter()`

`filter()` revolves around using comparison operators: 
`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal).

`dplyr` functions like `filter()` never modify inputs but instead return a new data frame that needs to be assigned to an object if you want to save the result.   
```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

## Boolean operators

`filter()` also supports the Boolean operators `&` ("and"), `|` ("or"), `!` (is "not"), and `xor` (exclusive "or".

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/operators.png")
``` 

## Boolean operators

Why does this not work?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)
```

Generally a good idea to use `x %in% y`, which will select every row where `x` is part of the values of `y`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

## `between` condition

Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. `between(x, left, right)` is equivalent to `x >= left & x <= right`.

To `filter()` all flights that departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive): 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, between(dep_time, 0, 600))
```

## `filter()` exercise

First, find all flights that had an arrival delay of two or more hours. Then find all flights that flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`).

<!-- ## `filter()` exercises solutions -->
<!-- Arrival delay of two or more hours -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- flights %>%  -->
<!--   filter(arr_delay > 120) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`) -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- flights %>% -->
<!--   filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## `arrange()`

`arrange()` takes a data frame and a set of column names to order the rows by. Multiple column names are evaluated subsequently.    

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(arrange(flights, year, month, day)[1:6, 1:6])
```

## `arrange()` in descending order
By dafault `arrange()` sorts values in ascending order. Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))[1:6, 1:6])
```

## `select()`

`select()` is used to select a subset of variables from a dataset. 

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/select.png")
```  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(select(flights, year, month, day)[1:4,])
```

## `select()`

`select()` has various helper functions:

* `everything()`: selects all variables.

* `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with "abc".

* `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with "xyz".

* `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain "ijk".

* `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression.

*  `num_range("x", 1:3)` matches `x1`, `x2` and `x3`.
   
## `select()`

You can use `select()` to rename variables

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```

which will drop all of the variables not explicitly mentioned. Therefore it's better to use `rename()` instead:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```

## `mutate()`

`mutate()` allows to add new columns to the end of your dataset that are functions of existing columns.

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mutate.png")
```  

## `mutate()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  select(ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time) %>% 
  mutate(gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
         speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
test <- flights %>% 
  select(ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time) %>% 
  mutate(gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
         speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
knitr::kable(test[1:6,])
```

## Functions to use with `mutate()`
There are many functions for creating new variables with `mutate()`:

* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (e.g. `air_time / 60`).
* Aggregate functions: `sum(x)` `mean(y)` (e.g. `mean(dep_delay)`).
* Logical comparisons, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`.
* ...

## `mutate()` exercises

Use `mutate()` to find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function (`?mutate`).

<!-- ## `mutate()` exercise solutions -->

<!-- 10 most delayed flights -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- flights %>% -->
<!--   mutate(dep_delay_rank = min_rank(-dep_delay)) %>% -->
<!--   arrange(dep_delay_rank) %>% -->
<!--   filter(dep_delay_rank <= 10) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## `summarize()`

`summarize()` collapses a data frame to a single row.

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/summarise.png")
```  

```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## `summarize()` with `group_by()`
`summarize()` is most effectively used with `group_by()`, which changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. 

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/group.png")
```  

Grouping is most useful in conjunction with `summarise()`, but you can also do convenient operations with `mutate()` and `filter()`.

## `summarize()` with `group_by()`
For example, to get the average delay per date

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## `summarize()` count
For aggregations it is generally a good idea to include a count `n()`. For example, letâ€™s look at the (not cancelled) planes that have the highest average delays:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>% 
  arrange(delay)
```

## `summarize()` useful functions

There are a number of useful summary functions:

* Measures of location: `mean(x)`, `sum(x)`, `median(x)`.
* Measures of spread: `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`, `mad(x)`.
* Measures of rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`.
* Measures of position: `first(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`, `last(x)`.
* Counts: `n()`, `sum(!is.na(x))`, `n_distinct(x)`.
* Counts and proportions of logical values: `sum(x > 10)`, `mean(y == 0)`.

## `summarize()` exercises

Use `summarize()` to find the carrier with the worst delays.

<!-- ## `summarize()` exercises solutions -->
<!-- Frontier Airlines (FL) has the worst delays. -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- flights %>% -->
<!--   group_by(carrier) %>% -->
<!--   summarise(arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% -->
<!--   arrange(desc(arr_delay)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Part II: Basic Introduction to collecting data from the web

## Browsing vs. scraping

- **Browsing**
  * you click on something
  * browser sends request to server that hosts website
  * server returns resource (often an HTML document)
  * browser interprets HTML and renders it in a nice fashion

## Browsing vs. scraping

- **Scraping with R**
  * you manually specify a resource
  * R sends request to server that hosts website
  * server returns resource
  * R parses HTML (i.e., interprets the structure), but does not render it in a nice fashion
  * it's up to you to tell R which parts of the structure to focus on and what content to extract

## Online text data sources

- **web pages** (e.g. http://example.com)
- **web formats** (XML, HTML, JSON, ...)
- **web frameworks** (HTTP, URL, APIs, ...)
- **social media** (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Tumbler, ...)
- **data in the web** (speeches, laws, policy reports, news, ... )
- **web data** (page views, page ranks, IP-addresses, ...)


## Before scraping, do some googling!

- If the resource is well-known, someone else has probably built a tool which solves the problem for you.
- [ropensci](https://ropensci.org/) has a [ton of R packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/) providing easy-to-use interfaces to open data.
- The [Web Technologies and Services CRAN Task View](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html) is a great overview of various tools for working with data that lives on the web in R.

## Extracting data from HTML

For web scraping, we need to:

1. identify the elements of a website which contain our information of interest
2. extract the information from these elements

## Extracting data from HTML

For web scraping, we need to:

1. identify the elements of a website which contain our information of interest;
2. extract the information from these elements

**Both steps require some basic understanding of HTML and CSS.** More advanced scraping techniques require an understanding of *XPath* and *regular expressions*.

## What's HTML?

**HyperText Markup Language**

* markup language = plain text + markups
* standard for the construction of websites
* relevance for web scraping: web architecture is important because it determines where and how information is stored

## Inspect the source code in your browser

**Firefox**
1. right click on page
2. select "View Page Source"

**Chrome**
1. right click on page
2. select "View Page Source"

**Safari**
1. click on "Safari"
2. select "Preferences"
3. go to "Advanced"
4. check "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
5. click on "Develop"
6. select "Show Page Source."

## CSS?

**Cascading Style Sheets**

* style sheet language to give browsers information of how to render HTML documents
* CSS code can be stored within an HTML document or in an external CSS file
* selectors, i.e. patterns used to specify which elements to format in a certain way, can be used to address the elements we want to extract information from
* works via tag name (e.g.,`<h2>`,`<p>`) or element attributes `id` and `class`

## Exercise

1. Complete the first 5 levels on [CSS Diner]("http://flukeout.github.io/")

## XPath

* XPath is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML-style document (including HTML)
* provides just another way of extracting data from static webpages
* you can also use XPath with R, it can be more powerful than CSS selectors

## Example

```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/wikiTable.png")
```  

## Inspecting elements

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/inspect-element.png")
```  

## Hover to find desired elements

```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/inspector.png")
```  

## `Rvest`

[rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) is a nice R package for web-scraping by (you guessed it) Hadley Wickham.

- see also: https://github.com/hadley/rvest
- convenient package to scrape information from web pages
- builds on other packages, such as xml2 and httr
- provides very intuitive functions to import and process webpages


## Basic workflow of scraping with rvest

```{r}
# 1. specify URL
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)" %>% 

# 2. download static HTML behind the URL and parse it into an XML file
read_html() %>% 

# 3. extract specific nodes with CSS (or XPath)
html_node(".wikitable") %>%

# 4. extract content from nodes
html_table(fill = TRUE)
```

## Selectorgadget

- [Selectorgadget](http://selectorgadget.com/) is a [Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=en) for quickly extracting desired parts of an HTML page.

* to learn about it, use vignette("selectorgadget")

* to install it, visit http://selectorgadget.com/

## Selectorgadget

```{r, eval = FALSE}
url <- "http://spiegel.de/schlagzeilen"
css <- ".mr-6"
url_parsed <- read_html(url)
html_nodes(url_parsed, css = css) %>% html_text
```

## Exercise

We want to collect some questions that users asks SPD candidate Olaf Scholz from [https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/profile/olaf-scholz/fragen-antworten](https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/profile/olaf-scholz/fragen-antworten).

a. What's the first thing you would do?
b. Oh no, SelectorGadget does not work. What else can we do?
c. Write a simple scraper to collect the first 12 questions
d. How can we get all the questions for Olaf Scholz? Every candidate?

<!-- ## Exercise solutions -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- questions <- paste0("https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/profile/", -->
<!-- "olaf-scholz/","fragen-antworten") %>%  -->
<!--   read_html() %>%  -->
<!--   html_nodes(".tile__question-text") %>%  -->
<!--   html_text() -->
<!-- ``` -->


## APIs

- API stands for *Application Programming Interface*
- defined interface for communication between software components
- *Web* API: provides an interface to structured data from a web service
- APIs should be used whenever you need to automatically collect mass data from the web
- it should definitely be preferred over web scraping

## Functionality of APIs

Web APIs usually employ a **client-server model**. The client â€“ that is you. The server provides the *API endpoints* as URLs.

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/api.png")
```  

## Functionality of APIs

Communication is done with request and response messages over *Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)*.

Each HTTP message contains a *header* (message meta data) and a *message body* (the actual content). The three-digit [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) plays an important role:

- 2xx: Success
- 4xx: Client error (incl. the popular *404: Not found* or *403: Forbidden*)
- 5xx: Server error
- The message body contains the requested data in a specific format, often JSON or XML.


## Examples of popular APIs

Social media:

- [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/)
- [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/) (restricted to own account and public pages)
- [YouTube (Google)](https://developers.google.com/youtube/)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/)
- For more, see [programmableweb.com](http://www.programmableweb.com/).

## API wrapper packages

- Working with a web API involves:
  - constructing request messages
  - parsing result messages
  - handling errors

- For popular web services there are already "API wrapper packages" in R:
  - implement communication with the server
  - provide direct access to the data via R functions
  - examples: *rtweet*, *ggmap* (geocoding via Google Maps), *wikipediR*, etc.

## Twitter

**Twitter has two types of APIs**

- REST APIs --> reading/writing/following/etc.

- Streaming APIs --> low latency access to 1% of global stream - public, user and site streams

- authentication via OAuth

- documentation at https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation

## Accessing the Twitter APIs

- To access the REST and streaming APIs, all you need is a Twitter account and you can be up in running in minutes!

- Simply send a request to Twitterâ€™s API (with a function like `search_tweets()`) during an interactive session of R, authorize the embedded `rstats2twitter` app (approve the browser popup), and your token will be created and saved/stored (for future sessions) for you!

- You can obtain a developer account to get more stability and permissions.

## Use twitter in R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rtweet)

## search for 1000 tweets using the #baerbock hashtag
tweets <- search_tweets(
  "#baerbock", n = 1000, include_rts = FALSE
)
```

Find out what else you can do with the `rtweet` package:
<https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet>

## Homework Exercise

1. We are still interested in getting data from [abgeordnetenwatch.de](https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/). The site has an API, so technically there is no need to scrape anything. Load the package `jsonlite` into library.

2. Go to https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/api and figure our the syntax of their APIs.

3. Collect some data from their API from a politician running in your constituency (or a constituency of your choice). Tip: Use the `fromJSON` function in `jsonlite` to load a JSON file via the API into R. Convert the output into a nicely formatted dataframe.

# Wrapping up
