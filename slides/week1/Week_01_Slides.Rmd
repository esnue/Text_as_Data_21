# Text as Data

## Text in the Social Sciences

> Text is the most pervasive — and certainly the most
persistent — artifact of political behavior (Monroe and Schrodt 2009)

Never before has so much text been so readily available in the social sciences: Legislative debates, party manifestos, political speeches, committee transcripts, lobbying documents, court opinions, laws, ...

## Unstructured Data

```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/unstructured.png")
```

There is no better time to start learning how to turn text into data than now!

## Text as Data Example: Scaling

```{r, out.width = "900px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/guardian.png")
```

## Text as Data Example: Personality

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/personality.png")
```


## Text as Data Example: Sentiment

```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/sentiment.png")
```

## From Text to Data

```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/text_to_data.png")
```   

## There are basically three varieties of text analysis

1. Literary (Discourse) analysis -> text as text
2. Qualitative text analysis -> human generated textual data
3. Quantitative text analysis -> machine generated textual data

##  Text as Data Methods

```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/text_methods.png")
```   

## Stages in Analyzing Text as Data (Benoit 2019)

1. Selecting texts and defining the corpus.
2. Converting of texts into a common electronic format.
3. Defining documents and choosing the unit of analysis.
4. Defining and refining features.
5. Converting of textual features into a quantitative matrix.
6. Analyzing the (matrix) data using an appropriate statistical procedure.
7. Interpreting and reporting the results

##  From Text to Matrix

```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/text_to_matrix.png")
```   

## 4 Principles of Automated Text Analysis

1. All quantitative models of language are wrong—but some are useful.
2. Quantitative methods for text amplify resources and augment humans.
3. There is no globally best method for automated text analysis.
4. Validate, Validate, Validate

# Text as Data Course

## This Course

- Introduction to automated text analysis methods using R
- We focus on application, not on theory
- This course should give you a skill set that you can use in your own projects and research
- Ask questions - and help each other out!

## Assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will have to complete three assignments.

## Assignment 1
The first assignment will be a code completion exercise in which you’ll be given a partially complete code. Full points will be awarded if you get the whole script to work.

## Assignment 2
The second assignment will involve the construction of a topic model, including a visualization and brief discussion of the results. Your grade for this assignment will be based on how you approach this task and if you follow the steps discussed in class.

## Assignment 3
Your final assignment is a presentation of a research project, or part thereof, of your own choosing. The only requirement is that the project involves the analysis of text and uses the methods that we cover in the course. Please record your presentation and submit it via Moodle. Grading will be determined by the quality of the presentation and the degree to which you manage to apply the skills what you have learned during the course.

## General Readings

- Wickham, H. and G. Grolemund. 2017. [R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data. O'Reilly.](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- Silge, Julia, and David Robinson. 2017. [Text mining with R: A tidy approach. O'Reilly.](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)  
- [quanteda R package](http://quanteda.io)


# Recap R & RStudio

## R
- Based on the statistical programming language S (1976)
- R was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (1995)
- R was intentionally developed to be a data analysis language

## Why R

- Open source: makes it highly customizable and easily extensible
- Over 18,000 packages and counting
- Used by many social scientists interested in data analysis
- Powerful tool to generate elegant and effective plots
- Command-line interface and scripts favors reproducibility
- Excellent documentation and online help resources

## We will work in RStudio

- RStudio is an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) and serves as: 
    
    - Code editor
    - Project manager
    - Workspace viewer
    - Data browser
    - Enhanced output viewer
    - Help browser


## The RStudio Interface

```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio.png")
```

## Basic workflow

- Edit in code editor (.r-file)
- Paste to console
- Save Workspace/Datasets (.Rdata-file)
- Save code routinely (no auto-save!)
- Press TAB to use RStudio's autocompletion feature

## Shortcuts

- Run code from editor: Select line and ctrl+Enter
- Switch between source and console: ctrl+1, ctrl+2
- Clear console: ctrl+L
- 'Arrow up' gives you the last line of code in the console
- Press Alt+Shift+K to see all keyboard shortcuts

# Setup

## Software

- Download and install latest versions of R (4.1.1) and RStudio (1.4.1717)
- Download and install Git
  - for Mac OS: `brew install git`

## Packages
- Install the following packages:

    + _tidyverse_
    + _quanteda_

## Setup GitHub

1. Create an account on GitHub 
2. Open RStudio and go to _Tools > Global Options…_ click on _Git/SVN_
3. Check _Enable version control interface for RStudio projects_
4. Set the path to the Git executable that you just installed. Open a shell, if you don’t know where Git is installed. Windows: type `where git` and hit enter. The path should be something like: `C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe`
Linux/OS X: type `which git` and hit enter. The path should be something like: `/usr/bin/git`
5. Restart RStudio, if it worked out you will find the Git icon on the top toolbar.

## Configure Git with RStudio

**set your user name and email:**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "YourName", 
                        user.email = "your@mail.com")
```

**create a personal access token for authentication:**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_github_token() 
```

**set personal access token:**
```{r}
credentials::set_github_pat("YourAccessToken")
```

## Clone a GitHub Repo

7. Copy the repository HTTPS urlfrom the text as data repository located on [https://github.com/mhaber/Text_as_Data_21](https://github.com/mhaber/Text_as_Data_21). Click on _Code_ and copy the HTTPS link of the project by clicking the little icon to the right of the URL.

8. In RStudio Select _File > New Project.._, select _Version Control_, Choose _Git_, then provide the repository HTTPS link, select the R workspace folder and create the project. RStudio now clones the content of the repository to your project folder. The content of the GitHub repository should now appear in the Files pane of RStudio.

## Create your own GitHub Repo

Task: Create your own GitHub repository for this course with an appropriate _README.md_ file and clone the repository in RStudio. Then create an _.R_ script file with a function to print _Hello World!_ and commit and push the new file to your GitHub repository.

# Wrapping up

## Questions?
