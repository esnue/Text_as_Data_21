**Instructor Information**

Matthias Haber is working as senior director for data & analytics at Looping Group. Previously, he was a research scientist at the Hertie School of Governance with research interests in party politics, electoral behavior, machine learning, survey experiments, and measurement problems. He holds degrees from the University of Mannheim, the University of Essex, and the University of Potsdam.

### Course Contents and Learning Objectives

There is an abundance of unstructured data around us. Working with text is key, not just to measure discussions and opinions on social media or in product reviews, but also to gain insights into concepts important to the study of politics such as ideological positions or policy sentiments. The vast amount of textual data that one frequently needs to process and the messy form that it often comes in poses special challenges to researchers. This course introduces students to computational tools and methods that enable them to treat text as data. We will touch upon core theoretical concepts, but the main goal is to give you hands-on experience in using R to collect, load, prepare and analyze text data. 

The course is taught using the R programming language and starts with an introduction to the fundamental data wrangling techniques to add structure to text. The next part of the course will focus on key concepts to pre-process text and prepare it for analysis. In the final part we will explore various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and scaling models. 

### Main learning objectives:
Gain hand-on experience working with different types of text data. 
Become familiar with core data-wrangling techniques.
Learn how and when to apply different types of text analysis models.

### Target group:
Students interested in learning how to programmatically work with text.  

### Teaching style:
We will mainly work through examples, using shared notebooks and environments. Students will be able to practice what they have learned in class in various exercises and assignments.

### Prerequisites:
Basic knowledge of R is required.

### Grading and Assignments

**Assignment 1**
The first assignment will be a code completion exercise in which you’ll be given a partially complete code. Full points will be awarded if you get the whole script to work.

**Assignment 2**
The second assignment will involve the construction of a topic model, including a visualization and brief discussion of the results. Your grade for this assignment will be based on how you approach this task and if you follow the steps discussed in class.

**Assignment**
Your final assignment is a presentation of a research project, or part thereof, of your own choosing. The only requirement is that the project involves the analysis of text and uses the methods that we cover in the course. Please record your presentation and submit it via Moodle. Grading will be determined by the quality of the presentation and the degree to which you manage to apply the skills what you have learned during the course. 

**Composition of the Final Grade**

| Name                            | Percent of Final Mark | Due             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Assignment 1: code completion exercise | 30%                   | October 22, 8 am  |
| Assignment 2: data analysis exercise | 30%                   | November 20, 8 am   |
| Assignment 3: Oral presentation of your own research project | 40%                 | December 17, 8am   |

**Late submission of assignments**

For each day the assignment is turned in late, the grade will be reduced by 10% (e.g. submission two days after the deadline would result in 20% grade deduction).

**Attendance**

Students are expected to be present and prepared for every class session. Active participation during lectures and seminar discussions is essential. If unavoidable circumstances arise which prevent attendance or preparation, the instructor should be advised by email with as much advance notice as possible. Please note that students cannot miss more than two out of 12 course sessions.
